    This is my stock market game. I had a lot of inspiration for this from my dad, who is an accountant. It makes me happy 
  that I can do this kind of stock market stuff without any risk and still be like my dad and have fun with it. I hope you 
  enjoy this as much as I do. I need to tell you a couple of things:
  1. It makes a file for itself and saves on it's own, don't worry about it. Just make sure to quit the game to save your progress
  2. Feel free to comment changes I should make, such as achievements and stuff like that. I would appreciate it.
  3. If you can code things like UI or maybe just a leaderboard, please contact me. I would love to make this a better game for everyone
  4. You can tweak the code how you want on your own, this isn't some kind of copyright thing. However, if you do make something that is based off this with some tweaks, I'd appreciate some credit
  5. Have fun. At the end of the day, this is still a game, with the main goal of making people happy and giving them something fun
I will try to update this as much as possible, I do get pretty busy. If you have any ideas or questions, feel free to contact me in some way,
or just comment, I will look at them. I hope you enjoy this as much as I do!
Sincerely,
ViktorTheGreat1
